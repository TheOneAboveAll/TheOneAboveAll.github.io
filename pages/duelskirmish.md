# Duel Skirmish
Score per player: 650

## Daily event:

* You need to log in twice for this event. Duel credits refresh at the middle of the event, and you should strive to do 5 Duels when it starts, and another 5 Duels after the Duel Credits refresh. 
* You are not restricted to Dueling Alliance members. You can Duel anyone by going into their profile or by using the search function: Click your Mailbox icon (lower left) -> friends -> search. Type their name
* Check the Alliance chat: We will always communicate how to find the Featured Champion. You should always strive to attack a 4-Star Featured Champion. 
I always have a list of champs below. I’ll try to update it as we go.

## Scoring:
You should strive to score the highest possible score per fight. That’s:

* 5 points for starting a Fight
* 55 points for beating a 4* opponent (this is really important, only go for the 4*)
* 5 extra points for beating the Featured Champion

Total: 65 points per fight, with a total of 650 points over the 10 possible fights (5 + 5).

## Objective:
10.000 Milestone is the main objective. 17.500 is the optimal but requires that EVERYONE do the Duels.
