# Draw Duplicates
**Minimum Score per player: 50**
This event tries to make us waste resources for the last Milestone. 
Our main objective is the first Premium Crystal Milestone. 
That said, if you have Arena Rewards dupes, open some dupes through Arena Crystals, or simply have a good stock of Premium Crystals, you can open a few more. But please constrain yourself

**Maximum Score per player: around 200 or 300...try not to go very high, save your crystals. Never open 3 and 4-Stars!**
**Minimum points per player if third Milestone has been reached: 0**
If the last milestone was, by some chance, reached, don’t waste any more points. Save those crystals. 
Zero score once in a while is ok for this event **if you don’t open crystals on any other occasion**

## Daily Event
Points for this event are based on drawing duplicates. There are two ways to obtain duplicates:

- From a crystal (the most common one)
- As an Arena reward

## Scoring

### Arena rewards:
Arena rewards stay in your STASH for 7 days! Save your duped rewards!
If you have a dupe 3-Star reward, don’t open any crystal - you’re done! =)

### Crystal List, by order of less valuable (use first) to more valuable (use last):

- Arena and 2-Star Crystals - start with these - chances are, you can get your 50 points from here - feel free to go beyond your 50 points minimum
	- You can earn 4x 2-Star Crystals at the Crystal Cornucopia during the weekend just with Milestones. Bonus: you get Battle Chips for the Crystal opening day (or money)!
- Arena Crystals: Need money? Open these - and maybe you’ll dupe your Punisher along the way!
- Versus Crystals also provide money and may offer a chance to dupe a 2-Star Punisher.
- Daily crystals - these will often dupe your 1 and 2 Stars
- It’s not worth opening Premium Crystals during this event - save them! Only open if you’ve opened all the available crystals, and make sure to only score 50 points.
- Do NOT use 3 and 4-Stars. Better to score zero then use these! Save ‘em for the Big Crystal Opening event!

## Notes on duped Arena rewards:
If you have arena rewards, they stay in your STASH for 7 days - more than enough to keep them there until the DUPE day. 
If a 3-day Dupe day is coming along, save it for that instead, since we usually finish the daily fairly easily.

**Tip**: When gathering ISO/Catalysts for your heroes, you can accidentaly claim your Arena hero by clicking the ‘Claim Max’ button. 
In order for you not to collect the Hero but still use the ‘Claim Max’, just click the filter icon (lower right), click Filter (again), slide down and press the catalyst and/or ISO 8 filters. That way, the character will not be presented on the list, and you can click the ‘claim all’ safely.
