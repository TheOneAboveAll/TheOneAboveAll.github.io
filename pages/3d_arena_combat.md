# Arena Combat (3 days)
**Ignore For Now**
This event is scored exactly like the regular Arena Wins.
It requires roughly 4,2x times the effort to score as in the regular Arena Wins (already considering the 3 days).
That said, if everyone hits the Arenas, especially by using his 3 and 4 stars, this should be doable.
Average points required per player: 16.670 (rounded up)
Points per day: 5560 (rounded up). Thatâ€™s equivalent to:
93 4-Star Wins per day OR
139 3-Star Wins per day OR
278 2-Star Wins per day
