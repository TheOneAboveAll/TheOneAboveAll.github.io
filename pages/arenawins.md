# Arena Wins
Minimum points required per player: 500 points
Average points for last Milestone: 1350 points

Basically, for each victory in an Arena, you get points. 
That’s a Victory against one champ only, so it’s fairly easy to score, unlike the 3-day event (see below).
People participating in Arenas to win high-tier prizes will likely score well beyond the average required - that’s ok. 
That said, always try to put in some points, even if the event is done or mostly done: show that you’re present and helping.

## Scoring
- For quick scoring, do the 4-Star Arena:
That’s 13 individual victories against 3-Stars that net you the required 500 points. It’s EASY! It’s 5 win streaks!
- Click the ‘HELP’ button every time you log in: help your fellow Alliance members score
