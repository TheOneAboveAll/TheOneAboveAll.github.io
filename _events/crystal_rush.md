# Crystal Rush
Minimum points per player: if third Milestone has been reached: save the crystals, use a single free crystal (4hours crystals) just to show your support.
Average points for Second-Third Milestone (Gold): 500-650 points 

## Daily Event
This event has crappy rewards, and the Alliance is saving Crystals for the BIG EVENTS. SAVE EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

- Do NOT use Champ crystals - those are for dupe days
- Need gold? Open Arena or Versus Crystals. If you score more than the average opening those it’s ok.
- Free Crystals and Quest Crystals are also nice to open for this event
- Avoid using other crystals - it’s likely some members will go over the Daily values, so if we reach the second or third milestone, just don’t use any. Just make sure we have achieved the intended second or third Milestone before the event ends. If you can’t, just open some Quest, Free, Arena or, in a last case scenario, one Daily Crystal or two (max)

## Reminder
NEVER use 2-Star Crystals (or 3-Star or 4-Star) or anything else that gives possible dupes. 
It’s completely not worth it. Yes, they give plenty of points, but they are also the only possible way of scoring on Dupe day. Save those for that day.
