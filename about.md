## About us

The Ones Above All is the best alliance for players who want to take their game-play to the next level.

We take the alliance events seriously and aim for the top-level rewards in all events.
However, we also know real life is more important than the game so please highlight to officers if you are not gonna participate in alliance event.

## Alliance and Chat rules
* Always continue to improve your champions
* Be active not only by logging in but by playing alliance events, try to gather the minimum amount of points required for the daily events
* Be conservative with your crystals
* Doing Multi-day events are decided by the officers: check the chat, commit to helping group when we decide to go for one
* If we work together, we can reap bigger and better rewards
* Have fun, and speak up if you do not agree with something
* Lack of activity over multiple events will get you kicked

### Note:
You do not need to save every single crystal, just try to save what you can. 
If you have a bunch of Premiums and 3-Star Crystals, sure, open a few ones. 
The idea here is that, if we all try to save most of the crystals, we will be able to complete Bigger Events and get Better rewards! 
Do not suffer unnecessarily! Participate in the events and try to do your part - we are in this together, we save together! =)
