CRYSTAL IS COMING UP, you all already know how to roll with this:

1. Open ONE and ONE ONLY low cost crystal ONLY, until every member has some points. Do NOT open crystals looking for Gold until everyone has points!
Low cost Crystals:
    * Quest Crystal
    * Versus Crystal (NOT Arena)
    * Free Crystal (that's the 4-hour free crystal)

2. Crystal opening strategy for the event (AFTER everyone has points): Open HALF of your crystals worth of points. SAVE the other half: We will update later on how to go about this event, whether we should open more or not.

3. Check your POINTS: a 4-star crystal is worth 25.000, while a Premium is worth 1.000. If you open a 4-star, you should aim at saving around ~20~25 worth of Premiums.

PS: I'm gonna be ruthless if anyone blows a Milestone because they decided to open a high score crystal! This is an easy event, and there doesn't need to be any rush. And again, open a small one, and wait for everyone!

We all know the drill by now. Let's enjoy this event! =)
