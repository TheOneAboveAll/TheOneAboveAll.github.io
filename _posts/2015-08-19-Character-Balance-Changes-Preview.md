# 2015/08/17 PREVIEW - Upcoming Balance Changes

## Overview
This batch of character changes and updates is aimed to bring a few characters up on the power curve and to fix several issues that players have experienced during gameplay, particularly when fighting in Alliance Quests. Bringing Armor Break, Regeneration, and Unstoppable in line with other effects is a major focus, in particular when used by the AI. Community feedback has been very helpful, and you may even find some of your ideas from our previous Character Balance Preview show up below. Some upcoming changes, such as those for Captain America, are more significant and will be coming at a later date.

## Captain America WW2:
- Fixed bug causing his Hero Rating to be artificially high

There was a bug causing his Hero Rating to be slightly higher than it should have been. It now appears correctly. Please note, this display fix does not affect his abilities or stats; he’s still as strong as ever!

## Deadpool:
- All regen amounts linked to the Power Meter
- Reduced 4-Star Deadpool's Maximum Health by 9% (no change to 2- and 3-Star versions)
- Increased the Bleed effectiveness on Hold Up (Special 3) as you Rank Up

Deadpool’s base Health, when combined with his regenerative abilities, made him difficult to fight against. He’s now more vulnerable to burst damage and Power Drain effects, but still has the option to trade some damage from using Special Attacks in order to play defensively and heal up. Overall, these changes shift some his power into offense, suitable for the merc with the mouth. 
NOTE: While at low Power, the amount Regenerated is lower than before. While at high Power, Regeneration amounts are greater than before.

## Daredevil:
- Improved Radar Sense to allow him to Evade more types of attacks

We found that Daredevil’s Radar Sense had too few targets to be effective against, and as such we’ve allowed Matt to spend some time training in the Hyperbolic ISO Chamber to hone his skills. He’s now capable of evading any attack that isn’t based on physical contact – even those as fast as beams or bullets. Iron Man better watch out.

## Hulkbuster:
- Moved the Hulk-Blaster (Special 2) Armor Break trigger to the three beam hits
- Armor Break now also removes Armor Up
- Slightly reduced the effectiveness of Armor Break, but increased the duration
- Increased the base damage of Hulk-Smasher (Special 1)

Hulkbuster’s Hulk-Blaster now has the potential to blast Hulk with up to three Armor Break stacks in one go. Previously, Armor Break was triggered by his shoulder-check, not the three beam hits. With a bit of luck, you’ll be drilling holes in your opponents for more damage than ever before. Not feeling lucky? Hulk-Bash! Oh, and enemies with Armor Up? Threat level: minimal.

## Iron Man & Superior Iron Man:
- Armor Break now also removes Armor Up
- Slightly reduced the effectiveness of Armor Break
- Increased the duration of Armor Break

Armed with Repulsor Rays and Uni-Beams, these metallic men blast their way through some of the thickest armors in the Battlerealm. The Armor Break inflicted by these beams is less frequent, but more potent than other Champions. We’ve increased the duration of these effects to give players an opportunity to capitalize on the window of weakness they expose in enemies. Make it count!

## Iron Fist:
- Armor Break now also removes Armor Up
- Reduced the effectiveness of Armor Break

Unlike the Iron Men, Iron Fist’s repeated, focused strikes are more about stacking the Armor Break effects to amp up his damage output after successive combos. His high frequency of Armor Break is sure to plow right through any opponent hoping to Armor Up. We’ve adjusted the effectiveness of each individual Armor Break to compensate for this added power.

## Juggernaut & Unstoppable Colossus:
- Unstoppable now triggers when activating a special attack
- Unstoppable duration now scales up as signature level increases

To recap the message above: Unstoppable has always been a very powerful ability within the contest, but it’s always been extremely defender biased and most often used more effectively by the AI rather than the player. This change ensures that both the players and their opponents get a chance to use Unstoppable and get to feel the excitement of shrugging off attacks.
NOTE: The Mystic Bosses found in Alliance Quests are also affected by this change, so we recommend planning around their Special Attacks. No longer will their Unstoppable catch you off guard.

## Magneto:
- Increased the reduction from Refraction
- Increased Heal Block scaling to last longer at higher tiers

Feedback from the community felt that Magneto’s Refraction ability is underpowered at lower levels – and we agree! Maybe The Collector was intimidated by such a powerful Mutant, and inhibited his full potential to avoid a catastrophic clash of polar opposites. Let’s find out what happens when the inhibitor collars come off of the ultimate Mutant. I give peace about a week.

## Rocket Raccoon:
- Fixed a bug that prevented his Signature Ability “Furocity” from scaling correctly

A little more bark and a little more bite...er, is that right? What does the Raccoon say? He’s much more of an offensive force than ever before...don’t say we didn’t warn you!

## Spider-Man:
- Armor Break now also removes Armor Up
- Slightly reduced the effectiveness of Armor Break

Well wobble my webs, yet another Champion with Armor Break. You know the drill: Thwips and Pows are a little less Pow-y and a little more Thwip-y. Or was it less Thwip-y and more Pow-y? Well, one thing’s for sure: Spidey has a new responsibility.

## War Machine:
- Armor Break now also removes Armor Up
- Slightly reduced the effectiveness of Armor Break

The heavy artillery shells fired during War Machine’s Shoulder Artillery and Heavy Ordnance special attacks now remove one instance of Armor Up when they hit, tearing through enemy Armor even more.

## Wolverine:
- Reduced maximum Health by 5%
- Basic Regeneration no longer triggers when struck by Critical Hits
- Regeneration now triggers periodically while both attacking and defending
- Regeneration effectiveness is now linked to the Power Meter
- Wolverine’s Bleed ability can now stack
- Wolverine’s Primal Rage (Special 3) now causes bleed

These changes aim to stay true to Wolverine’s regenerative powers, but even the playing field between attackers and defenders. Attacking with Wolverine now sees a greater benefit of Regeneration, which was previously extremely defender-bias; Regeneration triggers across the board are now much more consistent. We also amped up his Bleed by allowing it to stack, and added a new Bleed trigger to Primal Rage (Special 3).

**Special Note:** Because of the large change this represents, Realm of Legends Wolverine will still use the old system of regeneration.
