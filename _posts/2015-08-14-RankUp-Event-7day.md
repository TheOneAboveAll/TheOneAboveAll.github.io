Rank up 1 Stars if you can for the 7-day Rank up event! 1 Stars are really EASY and CHEAP to level

* Don't have 1 Stars? Open Daily crystals until you have one!
* You leveled all your 1-Stars? Sell them for ISO, and open Daily Crystals till you get one
* Once everyone has their Ranks IN, then you can start ranking up
* Plans AHEAD! It's a 7 day event, which means you'll have at chance at ranking ANY champ. Farm materials for your higher level champs first. Those are High Rank 3 Stars and any 4 Star Rank!

PS: Don't forget the Quest Completion Event!! We are almost done with that one, so try and balance that while farming for catalysts
